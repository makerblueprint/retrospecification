Production-Ready Modular Prototypes
===================================

Breadboards are meant for the workbench. Bummer.
------------------------------------------------
You should be able to throw your prototypes in a backpack. You should be able to update their programming while at the coffee shop. You should be able to put your prototypes into production immediately. That's the goal of Retro Specification. The spec aims to set up a middle-ground between breadboard and production board.

Since the enclosures are fairly easy to find, you can quickly kick-start the modular prototyping process. No need to buy a 3D printer... unless you want to. The spec also works well with wearables. Think the spec needs some revision? Please submit a pull request. Your feedback is truly appreciated.
