name: Audio Header
summary: A header compatible with front-panel desktop audio connectors.
description: >
  Pin-compatible with 'AC97' and 'HD Audio' headers, the audio
  header pinout aims to reinforce the most common standard in motherboard
  audio. Have an old desktop tower lying around? Grab the headphone/mic
  panel out of it & put it into your next build.
  Many modern single-board computers feature analog & digital audio, but
  are often broken out via consumer audio jacks. Consider this
  (or `retro-header-26`, for that matter) as standardized alternative.
  The keys on this connector are indeed important. The old AC97 & HD Audio
  connectors are in a 10 pin form-factor with pin 8 blocked. These
  connectors do not feature SPDIF. Another less-common pinout has been
  slightly adapted & appended to the 10 pin header. Keying on these
  additional pins allow custom single connectors to be constructed
  while preventing mis-mounts if a standard AC97 or HD Audio connector is used.
  Since AC97 & HD Audio are pin-compatible, it is easy to support both basic &
  advanced audio connections. If you have more sophisticated requirements,
  consider employing the techniques described in the HD Audio specification
  among the links below.
notes:
  -> The av-bus-five-volts-regulated pin should feature filtered 5VDC for
     use with analog audio circuits. This filtering is not a requirement,
     but will likely lead to cleaner analog audio signals.
