name: Battery Module
summary: A self-contained rechargeable battery module.
description: >
  Most connectors in the Retro Specification feature a `forty-volts-max` pin.
  Many also feature a `six-volts-max` pin. Ideally, the `battery`
  module's internal charging circuitry would properly charge its battery from
  the `forty-volts-max` pin.
  The contacts dedicated to power distribution are a tricky subject. Suppose
  your project has a host module with its own internal battery & a client
  module as well. Which module should supply power? It should be one or the
  other -- not both. For simple projects, you should be the arbiter. It is up
  to _you_ to ensure that you have only one power source in your project.
  For more advanced projects, consider the `battery-smart` module.
