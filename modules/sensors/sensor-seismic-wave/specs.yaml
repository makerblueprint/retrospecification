name: Seismic Wave Sensor Module
summary: A rudimentary early warning module.
description: >
  When an earthquake occurs, P-waves & S-waves rapidly travel from the
  epicenter. P-waves are not very destructive & travel much faster than
  S-waves. An accelerometer can be programmed to detect both, but is most
  useful when detecting a P-wave... since we humans usually do not notice
  these subtle waves. When detected, an alarm can announce that an earthquake
  has been detected. The S-wave may arrive immediately after the P-wave, or may
  arrive several seconds after. Since the epicenter is not known by the single
  device, estimations about the timing & magnitude of the S-wave is nearly
  impossible. Multiple sensors, networked across a large region, have greater
  ability to build such estimations.
