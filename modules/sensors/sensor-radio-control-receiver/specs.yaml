name: Radio Control Receiver Module
summary: Optimized to transcode off-the-shelf RC receiver signals to CAN & I2C.
description: >
  The essence of this module is minimum viable product. Instead of attempting
  to be compatible with all radio signals generated by commercial RC
  transmitters, this module will aim for compatibility with off-the-shelf RC
  receivers. This allows you to purchase the receiver designed for your
  transmitter, connect it to the Retro Module & close the lid.
  The module features three inputs: 2x `ppm` & 1x `s-bus`. Most quality RC
  receivers feature PPM output. For those receivers that don't, you can use an
  inexpensive converter such as the RMILEC Signal Converter.
  The heart of the module is a microcontroller capturing the `ppm` & `s-bus`
  signals and mapping them to values that can be sent over CAN & I2C.
  With the three inputs, up to three RC transmitters can be simultaneously used
  with the Retro Module.
notes:
  -> Many who connect RC receivers to microcontrollers opt for deciphering one
     or more PWM signals. A more effective route is to decipher the far more
     capable PPM & S.Bus signals.
