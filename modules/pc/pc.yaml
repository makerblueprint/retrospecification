  Some things are best left to beefy machines (e.g. graphics). Graphics can be
  queued, however, with basic low-bandwidth directives. Consider a venue with
  one or more performers. The performers may queue animations on the backdrop
  behind them via arm or mouth movements. The heavy computation is performed by
  the computer behind the screen -- not the microcontroller on the performer.
  These animations may also include sound, which may best be heard through a
  large sound system behind the performer. The classic computer is the best
  option for sound effects processing.
