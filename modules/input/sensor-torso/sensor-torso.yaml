name: Torso Rotation Sensor Module
summary: Detect rough rotation of the torso.
description: >
  Mounted on the waist & hips, rough rotation of the upper body -- in
  relation to the lower body -- may be determined via variable resistors. More
  sophisticated, accurate, and expensive options are available. Low-cost
  off-the-shelf sensors will be noted here. Custom modules should remain as
  simple as possible. More soon...
