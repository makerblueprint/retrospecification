name: Neck Rotation Sensor Module
summary: Detect rough rotation of the neck, relative to the shoulders.
description: >
  Mounted on the head & shoulders, rough rotation of the neck -- in relation to
  the shoulders -- may be determined via variable resistors. More
  sophisticated, accurate, and expensive options are available. Low-cost
  off-the-shelf sensors will be noted here. Custom modules should remain as
  simple as possible. More soon...
