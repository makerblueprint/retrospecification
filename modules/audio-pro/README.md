Pro Audio Modules
=================
Many of the connectors in this specification feature both analog & digital
signals. Digital signals next to analog audio lines may cause interference.
Depending on the project, this interference may be tolerable. In the pro
audio realm, interference is avoided at all costs.
These modules adhere to that rigid standard.
