  - Make ioio-otg.jar file. It should declare a function named 'getPin'.
     The 'getPin' function will return (int) pin based on the passed argument.
     This board features multiple SPI & I2C interfaces. There are at least two
     I2C buses on the board. The function should, by default, return the data
     & clock pins for the bus with the lowest numeric value
     (DA0/CL0 instead of DA1/CL1).
