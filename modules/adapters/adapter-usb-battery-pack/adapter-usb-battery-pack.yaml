name: Adapter - USB Battery Pack
summary: Use any off-the-shelf battery USB device charger.
description: >
  Traditional USB ports provide five volts regulated power. Pocket USB battery
  packs usually feature a LiPo battery, a 5V voltage regulator & charge
  controller. They typically are charged via a micro-USB port.
  Most of the connectors in The Retro Specification include both a
  `six-volts-max` and a `forty-volts-max` contact. Since Retro Modules are
  frequently daisy-chainable, power can be passed from one module to another.
  To use a USB Battery Pack as a power source, wire it up to the
  `six-volts-max` and/or the `forty-volts-max` contact(s). Just make sure
  it is the _only_ power source when you connect modules together.
