name: USB Micro Adapter
summary: Turn a USB-OTG device into a Retro Module.
notes:
  - When in a vehicle, it is preferable to have mobile devices plugged in to
    charge. Many mobile devices feature USB-OTG capabilities. This allows the
    mobile device to act as a USB host for peripheral devices. If you have
    already outfitted your vehicle with a microcontroller, your adapter can be
    set up to send data back & forth from the microcontroller and the mobile
    device. Since the spec features CAN bus, it is fairly easy to have your
    vehicle feed data to both devices as well. Some vehicle stereos also
    feature CAN bus.
