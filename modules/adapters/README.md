Adapter Modules
===============
Frequently, we want to adapt one thing... to work with that other thing. That's
what these modules are for.

Most of these have limited use cases, but that's what's so great about Retro
Modules: they are great for even the most niche of use cases. There are people
out there (you may be one of them) who want to bring fifty-year-old computers
onto the web. That computer probably had a standard interface, in it's day.
Adapters have traditionally been just pair of connectors & wires. Throw a
RESTful microcontroller in there, if you'd like.
