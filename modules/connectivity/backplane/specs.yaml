name: Backplane
summary: A client module for your workbench.
description: >
  As a project grows, more & more modules may be required. Power distribution
  via a backplane is preferable to passing power through a long chain of
  modules.
  In this system, backplanes are simply an alternate means of connecting host
  modules to client modules. The backplane itself is a client module. This
  allows you to build your project around whatever host module seems best for
  that project (e.g. Arduino, BeagleBone, Pi, PIC, etc). Backplanes can feature
  far more, depending on the needs of your project.
