name: Thermostat-Controlled Dry Ice Feeder
summary: Automatically feed dry ice into water for cooling and/or effects.
description: >
  By default, when powered up the device would feed bits of dry ice into
  water automatically -- based on temperature readings near the vent. A control
  surface could be added to manually adjust how cold air near the exhaust
  should be. This value (and others) could be adjusted via another CAN-BUS node
  if connected.
  For greater reaction, a heating element may be added to the water &
  automatically switched on if necessary.
