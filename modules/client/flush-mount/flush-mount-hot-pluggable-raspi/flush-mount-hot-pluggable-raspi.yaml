name: Flush-Mount Hot-Pluggable Raspberry Pi module
description: >
  `raspberry-pi` computers are pretty remarkable tiny machines. They are mainly
  used for experimental & educational purposes. Many are used as household
  servers or media centers. Some are even used as nodes in experimental
  super-computer configurations. Few, however, have been standardized to the
  point where they can be hot-pluggable (e.g. to a backplane).
  This Retro Module proposal is just that. Hack a RasPi into an old SCSI HDD
  tray, and make a backplane for it. Add components in the tray to help the
  Pi stay powered & safely shut down if pulled from the bay.
