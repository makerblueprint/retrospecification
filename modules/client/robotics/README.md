Robotics Modules
================
Robots are generally self-containted environment-aware computational units.
Each may have millions of modules; from a tiny IC, to an off-the-shelf hand
and beyond. It is much easier to build a robot hand or foot over the course of
few months -- instead of a complete robot in one go. Since they're modular,
the robot can take shape with ease.

Animatronics
------------
Robotic elements, often connected to a larger computer built with the intent to
entertain. The technology has been used in theme parks & Hollywood for years.
While not nearly as popular as in the glory days, animatronics still play vital
roles in practical effects departments & puppetry. In recent years, cosplayers
have embraced the art... bringing their costume/puppet that much closer to
their character.

Modules listed here are meant to be generic in nature. You may be making
Falkor the luck dragon. You won't find a `falcor` module listed here, but there
is a [ear-dog-floppy](ear-dog-floppy/ear-dog-floppy.yaml) module. Use it as a
starting point.

Module details are sparse, right now. More soon...
