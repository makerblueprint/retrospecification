name: Voltage Sensor Module
summary: Detects voltage within a range & provides analysis.
notes:
  - Should be able to detect AC voltage patterns.
  - Should provide notes on nominal voltage based on type of voltage (AC/DC).
  - Should fire event if voltage suddenly spikes or dips.
  - Should fire event if voltage drops & stays below configured threshold(s).
  - Should fire event if voltage consistently exceeds configured threshold(s).
