name: Arm Motion Sensor
summary: Detect rough abduction, adduction & extension of the arm.
description: >
  Mounted on the shoulder, rough position of the arm may be determined via
  simple variable resistors. More sophisticated, accurate, and expensive
  options are available. Low-cost off-the-shelf sensors will be noted here.
  Custom modules should remain as simple as possible.
  More soon...
