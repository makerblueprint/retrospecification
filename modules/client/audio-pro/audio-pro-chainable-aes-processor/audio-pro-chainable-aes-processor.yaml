name: Pro Audio - Chainable AES Processor
description: >
  Rack-mount digital audio processors frequently feature 3-pin XLR connectors
  for routing of data from & back to a digital mixer. With the `audio-pro-xlr6`
  connector spec, these signals can be sent via a single connector.
  A mixer could feature one female `audio-pro-xlr6` connector for each channel.
  Processors could feature one male & one female `audio-pro-xlr6` connector.
  If a particular channel requires three chained effects processors, only one
  cable would be required on that third processor. The processors would be
  able to automatically detect if signal is being fed back to them from another
  processor down the line. If no signal is detected, the processor routes its
  unmodified signal back up the chain. If the second processor fails, the first
  processor automatically returns its unmodified signal.
