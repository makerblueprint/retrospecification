  Many small cars only need a little extra oomph from a woofer. These small
  cars usually have little room to spare in the trunk, making quick removal
  of a speaker & amplifier a worthwhile endeavor.
notes:
  - Consider using just one of the two connectors below. Which one depends on
    the capabilities of the amplifer & head unit.
