What is a 'Client' Device?
--------------------------
This specification suggests a different vision of what should be considered a
client device.
It's a matter of perspective. We typically view desktops as host machines, and
anything connected to them, peripheral devices (including microcontrollers).
These powerful computers, however, rarely control motors, servos & the like.
They are masters of pixel manipulation, number crunching & storage. Their
interfaces (e.g. USB & HDMI) are feature-rich, but have a steep learning curve
if you want to hack them. The same applies to many other common devices
(e.g. planes, trains & automobiles). This is why this spec classifies them as
client devices.

Client devices feature common -- often locked-down -- interfaces. Some client
devices have great power to manipulate tangible items (such as a train engine
triggering the brakes on hundreds of railroad cars), while others do not.
Classifying them all as client devices is a matter of convenience for those who
adopt this spec.
