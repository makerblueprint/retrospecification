name: Whistle
summary: Aint nothing like a steam-driven whistle.
description: >
  If you can manage a water boiler & whistle configuration, do it.
  If you cannot, there are still ways to imitate the real thing. Dry ice can be
  used to generate the 'steam' which could be propelled via fan. A speaker near
  or inside the whistle can generate pre-recorded steam whistle sounds. For
  larger whistles, full-spectrum reproduction of the sound effect is very
  important. Consider hiding a sub-woofer & mid-range speaker in your build.
