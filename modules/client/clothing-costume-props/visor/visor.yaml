name: Visor
summary: A surface that protects the eyes.
description: >
  A surface that protects the eyes, such as shading them from the sun or other
  bright light or protecting them from objects. Visors may take many forms, but
  the important characteristic shared by all: they are for the eyes. As such,
  visors are prime candidates for a `head-up-display`. There are limitations,
  of course, as referenced below. Consider a minimal approach, at first.
