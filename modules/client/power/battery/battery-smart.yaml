name: Smart Battery Module
summary: A digitally controllable self-contained rechargeable battery module.
description:
  For simple projects, consider building a basic `battery` module.
  The contacts dedicated to power distribution are a tricky subject. Suppose
  your project has a host module with its own internal battery & a client
  module as well. Which module should supply power? It should be one or the
  other -- not both.
  The smart battery module concept is a work in progress. Feedback on how to
  best address power management automatically would be greatly appreciated.
