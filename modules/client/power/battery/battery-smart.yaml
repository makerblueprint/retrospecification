name: Smart Battery Module
summary: A digitally controllable self-contained rechargeable battery module.
description:
  For simple projects, consider building a basic `battery` module.
  The contacts dedicated to power distribution are a tricky subject. Suppose
  your project has a host module with its own internal battery & a client
  module as well. Which module should supply power? It should be one or the
  other -- not both.
  The smart battery module concept is a work in progress. Feedback on how to
  best address power management automatically would be greatly appreciated.
proposals:
  power_pre_check:
      The best & simplest solution seems to be battery modules which check the
      power rails for voltage before introducing any new power. There is a risk
      that two battery modules on the same system could complete their system
      check at the same time. This risk is minimal, though.
  battery_present_plus_delay:
      Batteries do not provide power on any bus by default. Each battery checks
      the power rails to see if power is needed. One of them decides to make a
      move. It connects a resistor from `forty-volts-max` to `common`.
  host_as_arbiter:
      Have the host module in the project be the arbiter.
      Allow all modules in the project initially power up in a low power mode.
      The main host module could query for any battery modules.
      If one is found, the host module could tell the `battery` module to send
      power via the `forty-volts-max` contact(s). By default, all modules should
      prefer power from the `forty-volts-max` contact(s). Once the `battery`
      module heeds instructions to send power to` forty-volts-max` contact(s),
      all the other modules in the project could begin using power on that rail
      instead. After this transition, the main host module can power down its
      internal 5VDC regulator and send instructions to the `battery` module to
      provide power on that rail instead. Each module would need appropriate
      circuitry to remain powered while these transitions occur.
      The `forty-volts-max` bus should have no voltage on it, by default.
    scenarios:
      Given the host module requires an external battery
        And power is available on the `forty-volts-max` contact(s)
        And power is available on `twelve-volts-max` contact(s)
          Then the host module should utilize power from the `forty-volts-max` contact(s)
          And client module(s) should utilize power from the `forty-volts-max` contact(s)
      Given the host module requires an external battery
        And power is not available on the `forty-volts-max` contact(s)
        And power is available on the `twelve-volts-max` contact(s)
          Then the host module should utilize power from the `twelve-volts-max` contact(s)
          And client module(s) should utilize power from the `twelve-volts-max` contact(s)
          And client module(s) should conserve power wherever possible
