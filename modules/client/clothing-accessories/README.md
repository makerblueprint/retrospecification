Clothing Accessory Modules
==========================
Clothing accessories have gotten smart. From smart shirts to smart glasses to
smart shoes, computers today can be integrated into nearly anything.
This section is rated G & covers just a bit of what's out there.

Consider, as you build, adding wireless capabilities to your wearables. Most go
straight to Bluetooth control capabilities (which is cool)... but consider open
wireless protocols as well. A host module could broadcast, openly, control
signals to any other modules that might be listening. Your smart wardrobe (and
your friends' smart wardrobe) could always be in sync.
Make sure to comply with established local wireless regulations.
