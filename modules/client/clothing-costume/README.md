Clothing - Costume
==================
These are modules related to costumes. While costumes differ greatly from
one to another, they share common issues: cooling, heating, lighting & sound.

General Cooling Tips
--------------------
There are a few tricks you may consider to help keep you or your other
cool & their helmet from fogging up.
Always make sure to stay hydrated. Anti-moisture hacks are useful to keep
sweat under control... but your body is still losing moisture.

First, take a look at RV humidity control techniques. One techique in
particular uses tiny water-absorbing polymer beads. These beads can often
be found in small packets inside a shipped package. Install pockets in
the hotter areas of the costume to hold packets like these. You can get the
beads in bulk at many RV supply stores. Make up some disposable packets with
breathable fabric. These can be particularly useful in helmets. Just be
careful to keep them further away from your face -- and away from children.

Consider a personal air conditioning unit. There are many off-the-shelf
solutions, but most are pretty bulky. This guy on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyJILFrtb5U) seems to have the
right idea. There are many other solutions, including vests & scarves.
Additional detail can be found in the [cooling](../cooling)
section.

Finally, hydration. One of the best solutions is the good-old camel-back
water bladder with tube. The tube can stay tucked away under a collar or be
routed inside a helmet.
