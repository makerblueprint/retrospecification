name: Mech Boot
summary: Make robot boots all the more convincing with integrated effects.
description: >
  Is your robot costume silent? Consider adding stompy sound effects to your
  costume by integrating a step-detecting audio player into each boot. Perhaps
  the robot runs hot? Route pipes from a cooler with dry ice down to 'exhaust
  ports' on the boots. Make sure to light the ports accordingly.
