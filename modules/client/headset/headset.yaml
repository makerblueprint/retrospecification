name: Headset
summary: A headset combines a headphone with a microphone. Some include video.
description: >
  The most common headsets are those for cell phones, featuring a mic somewhere
  near the headphones. These use a `audio-phone-mini-trrs` connector. Many
  older headsets connect to the host device via a pair of
  `audio-phone-mini-trs` connectors. Others may connect to a computer via USB.
  In professional audio environments, headsets are usually part of an
  `intercom` system. These likely use a `audio-pro-xlr6-switchcraft` contact
  configuration.
  Legacy video headsets frequently connect to the video source via `composite`.
  Newer headsets, such as Oculus or Vive, connect to the video source via HDMI
  and USB. Audio and control signals may flow through HDMI and/or USB. Future
  iterations will probably use a single `usb-c` connector.
ideas:
  - A module fully compatible with a standardized Apple/Android headset. Audio
    from the av-bus is routed to the headphones. The electret microphone is
    powered & signal is routed to the `av-bus-mic` contacts. Control signals
    from the on-headset remote are interpreted by the module and sent to a
    host module via I2C/SPI/CAN.
