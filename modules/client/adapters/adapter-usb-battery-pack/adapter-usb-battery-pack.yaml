description: >
  Traditional USB ports provide five volts regulated power. Pocket USB battery
  packs usually feature a LiPo battery, a 5V voltage regulator & charge
  controller. They typically are charged via a micro-USB port.
  Most of the connectors in The Retro Specification include a
  `fifteen-volts-max` contact. Since Retro Modules are daisy-chainable,
  that regulated power is passed from one module to another.
