summary: Use any off-the-shelf battery USB device charger.
description: >
  Traditional USB ports provide five volts regulated power. Pocket USB battery
  packs usually feature a LiPo battery, a 5V voltage regulator & charge
  controller. They typically are charged via a micro-USB port.
  Most of the connectors in The Retro Specification include a
  `fifteen-volts-max` contact. Since Retro Modules are daisy-chainable,
  that power is passed from one module to another. If a particular
  module requires power, it can tap into the `fifteen-volts-max` bus.
connectors:
  - dsub-db-25
  - usb-a
  - usb-micro
