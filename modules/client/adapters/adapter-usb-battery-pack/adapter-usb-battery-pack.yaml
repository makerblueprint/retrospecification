description: >
  Traditional USB ports provide five volts regulated power. Pocket USB battery
  packs usually feature a LiPo battery, a 5V voltage regulator & charge
  controller. They typically are charged via a micro-USB port.
  Most of the connectors in The Retro Specification include a
  `regulated-five-volts` contact. Since Retro Modules are daisy-chainable,
  that regulated power is passed from one module to another. If a particular
  module requires power, it can tap into that 5V bus.
  Most connectors also include one or more `thirty-volts-max` contacts. These
  contacts could easily be connected to a 6V, 9V, 12V or 19V power source. With
  a 20V-tolerant 5V voltage regulator, the USB battery pack could be charged
  from a variety of sources.
