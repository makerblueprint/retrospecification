name: USB B Adapter
summary: Turn a classic USB peripheral device into a Retro Module.
notes:
  - This adapter would likely require a tiny Linux computer to host consumer
    USB peripheral devices. With $5 Linux computers, it is within reason to
    build adapters with a full computer inside. One adapter could be programmed
    to be compatible with one peripheral, or compatible with many.
