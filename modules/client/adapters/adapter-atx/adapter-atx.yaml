name: ATX Power Supply Adapter
summary: Safely adapts a PC power supply to provide power to other modules.
notes:
  - Make sure to include some form of basic load whenever your power supply is
     on. These devices are expecting a computer motherboard attached to them
     whenever powered up. Maintaining a load at all times (e.g. an 8 Ohm
     resistor rated at > 3 watts) reduces stress on the internal components.
  - Make sure proper fuses are in place for conversion to smaller connectors.
    Many power supplies can provide a significant amount of current. Some
    Retro Module connectors are not rated for vast amounts current. Fuses help
    reduce risk.
ideas:
  -> host modules may use `regulated-five-volts-standby` on
     `molex-mixed-voltage-24-r2` connectors
  - full power supply can be turned on via request over CAN/SPI/I2C
