summary: Use the power from an old laptop or printer brick.
description: >
  Most laptop power supplies output right around 19VDC. If you have a power
  brick stating it supplies twenty volts or less, it can be easily integrated
  into your collection of modules. Most connectors in The Retro Specification
  have one or more `forty-volts-max` contacts. Power can be passed through
  one module to another with ease. If a module requires power, it can use
  either power from the `fifteen-volts-max` bus or power from the
  `forty-volts-max` bus. If a particular module is power-hungry, it should
  prefer power from the `forty-volts-max` bus... and could fall back to the
  `fifteen-volts-max` bus if necessary (e.g. low-power mode).
  Many inexpensive voltage regulators can tolerate up to about twenty volts.
  The power needs of one module may differ from that of another. A five volt
  regulator may be your regulator of choice, but certain modules may need
  twelve volts or more. The `forty-volts-max` bus provides some flexibility.
