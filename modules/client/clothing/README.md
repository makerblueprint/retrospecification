Clothing Modules
================
While many are already adding effects to garments, few seem to take the extra
step to make their garments compatible with each other. Pants with integrated
tech are a module, just like anything else. Pants... connected to a glowy belt
module featuring capacative touch sensors... is a great combo. A spinning
bow-tie module controlled by a capacative-touch belt module could make that
next comedic kiss on the cheek all the more memorable.

These modules should be able to operate independently or in concert with other
modules. Low-power wireless communication amongst garments is preferable... but
is more expensive & complex.

Just keep in mind: there is a balance which can be struck between gently
accentuated everyday clothes vs. all-out costumes.
