# Forty Volts Max Bus Term
A DC bus which, per this specification, cannot exceed 40 [Volts](../../volt.md).

This range was chosen for these following reasons:
* Voltages in the specified range are largely safe
* Many off-the-shelf DC power sources range from 1-36 Volts.
* Small wires can be used for many power-hungry applications

## Notes
* For lower-power applications, consider using the [Six Volts Max Bus](../six-volts-max/README.md).
