# Six Volts Max Bus Term
A DC bus which, per this specification, cannot exceed 6 [Volts](../../volt.md).

This range was chosen for these following reasons:
* Voltages in the specified range are supported by most low-voltage development boards
* A simple 4x AA or AAA enclosure can be used to supply power on this bus
* A standard-fare USB power source can be used to supply power on this bus

## Notes
* For more power-hungry applications, consider using the [Forty Volts Max Bus](../forty-volts-max/README.md).
