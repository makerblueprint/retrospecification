# Polarizing Key Term
> Some systems polarize or key the pin header connection with something that fills and blocks one of the holes in the sockets. One pin of the wrong pin header (or the correct pin header rotated in the wrong orientation) hits that obstruction and prevents an incorrect connection. The correct pin header has one or more pins in the header removed or clipped to indicate a key for correct orientation.
