# Controller Area Network Term
> A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed
to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in
applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol,
designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles, but
is also used in many other contexts.
