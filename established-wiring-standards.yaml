notes:
  -> On a cable with with both ribbed & smooth insulation, the smooth side
     should always be connected to the voltage source. This voltage source
     could be the red terminal on a battery/amplifier, or the 'hot' in an
     AC power circuit.
  - Motherboard power cable color schemes should be reinforced where possible:
    - red:    five-volts-regulated
    - purple: unswitched-five-volts-regulated
    - yellow: twelve-volts-regulated
    - black:  ground
    - blue:   negative-twelve-volts-regulated
    - orange: three-point-three-volts-regulated
    - green:  power-request-circuit
