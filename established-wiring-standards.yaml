notes:
  - On a cable with with both ribbed & smooth insulation, the smooth side
     should always be connected to the voltage source. This voltage source
     could be the red terminal on a battery/amplifier, or the 'hot' in an
     AC power circuit.
  - Motherboard power cable colors should be reinforced where possible:
    - red:    five-volts-regulated
    - purple: unswitched-five-volts-regulated
    - yellow: twelve-volts-regulated
    - black:  common
    - blue:   negative-twelve-volts-regulated
    - orange: three-point-three-volts-regulated
    - green:  power-request-circuit
  - "Crimp on connectors should never be used on solid core wire or on wire
     that has been tinned."
  - "Ferrite chokes electronically isolate signal cables from the power
     network. Using a high-quality shielded [data] cable with built-in or
     external Ferrite chokes to help reduce interference on the line from
     any motors and to help reduce the effects of electro-static discharge."
  - "Daisy chaining is one way of powering several different [modules].
     Multiple [modules] are wired together, with each unit being powered by the
     one before it in the chain. It is common to daisy chain the power
     terminals on [...] motor and servo controllers. In a haphazardly-wired
     setup, daisy chaining can cause many issues. If one connection in the
     middle of the chain comes loose, the power to the remaining [modules]
     will drop. [...] A better way to design a power distribution network is to
     use a power distribution terminal [...]. With this method, if any one
     controller disconnects, the other controllers will continue working."
