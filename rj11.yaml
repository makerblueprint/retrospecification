description: The proposed Retro Specification for RJ11 connectors.
summary: >
  These connectors are being used less and less frequently by consumers.
  It may be a bit too soon to respecify these connectors, but their
  inexpensive and generally hardy characteristics make them ideal
  candidates for respecification. They are commonly used for telephone
  land-lines and DSL modems.
  Ideally, these will be the primarily used in wearable devices.
  Think of them as... the end of the line.
  Many hardware stores carry four-wire thin telephone cables. These
  four-wire cables can drive a small set of NeoPixels without issue.
  Six-wire cables add a ADC and PWM lines. Either of these can utilize
  the 1-wire protocol if basic IO is needed.

requirements:
  -> Telephone cables must be adapted to be 1:1 cables.
     Contact 1 should always be contact 1, etc.
  -> Production modules must be able to tolerate 5VDC logic.
