name: Qualcomm Quick Charge Adapter
summary: Faster mobile charging by safely sending 12VDC over a Micro USB cable.
description: >
  For devices featuring `micro-usb`, charging speed has been an issue.
  Newer devices feature additional circuitry which can communicate with
  Qualcomm Quick Charge certified power supplies. When the power supply
  confirms the client device can receive 12VDC instead of 5VDC, it sends it.
  The charging circuit in the client device can handle this higher voltage
  and put it to immediate use.
