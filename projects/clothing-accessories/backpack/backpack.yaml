name: Backpack
summary: That thing you wore in school.
description: >
  Often used to carry big things or hide less sightly items, backpacks are
  ideal for housing host controllers & power systems. They may also be
  accentuated with neopixels, EL-wire & audio capabilities. Consider automatic
  illumination of a pocket interior if it is opened.
  Most wearing backpacks wear them out of necessity. Dedicating a large section
  of a backpack to wearable tech is less than ideal. Thankfully, wearable
  devices are often small & require little power. Make sure to properly protect
  these devices from the elements & rough conditions inside the pack.
