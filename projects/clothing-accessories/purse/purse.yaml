name: Purse
summary: Or satchel... if you'd like.
description: >
  Often used to carry a few bigger things or hide less sightly items, purses
  are ideal for housing host controllers & power systems. They may also be
  accentuated with neopixels, EL-wire & audio capabilities. Consider automatic
  illumination of the purse interior if it is opened.
  Most wearing purses wear them out of necessity. Dedicating a large section
  of a purse to wearable tech is less than ideal. Thankfully, wearable devices
  are often small & require little power. Make sure to properly protect these
  devices from the elements & rough conditions inside the purse.
