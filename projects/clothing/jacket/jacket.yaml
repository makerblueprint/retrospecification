name: Jacket
summary: Add popular luminous effects to a jacket.
description: >
  Jackets are generally opaque & loose fitting. Consider adding bright LEDs
  to shine off your shirt. Lighting effects are usually best when the source
  of the light is not easily noticed. Lining can be added in front of the LEDs
  to help diffuse the light before it reaches your shirt.
ideas:
  - consider integrating wireless capabilities so the jacket can sync up with
    other accessories you may have -- or clothes others near you may be wearing
