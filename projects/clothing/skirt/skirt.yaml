summary: Add popular luminous effects to a skirt.
description: >
  Recently, skirts with semi-transparent outer layers have been adorned with
  multi-color LEDs sewn into the lower layers of the skirt. The diffusion
  provided by the outer layers helps hide the conductive thread & the somewhat
  unsightly LEDs themselves.
  More opaque skirts offer fewer avenues for accentuation. Consider
  integrating sanded fiber-optic cables around the edges... or EL wire if
  appropriate.
  Some designers are introducing shape-shifting accessories to skirts, which
  can certainly steal the show if executed well.
