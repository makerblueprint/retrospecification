Clothing Modules
================
While many are already adding effects to garments, few seem to take the extra
step to make their garments compatible with each other. Pants with integrated
tech are a module, just like anything else. Pants... connected to a glowy belt
module featuring capacative touch sensors... is a great combo. A spinning
bow-tie module controlled by a capacative-touch belt module could make that
next comedic kiss on the cheek all the more memorable.

These modules should be able to operate independently or in concert with other
modules. Low-power wireless communication amongst garments is preferable... but
is more expensive & complex.

Just keep in mind: there is a balance which can be struck between gently
accentuated everyday clothes vs. all-out costumes.

Clothing Accessory Modules
--------------------------
Clothing accessories have gotten smart. From smart shirts to smart glasses to
smart shoes, computers today can be integrated into nearly anything.
This section is rated G & covers just a bit of what's out there.

Consider, as you build, adding wireless capabilities to your wearables. Most go
straight to Bluetooth control capabilities (which is cool)... but consider open
wireless protocols as well. A host module could broadcast, openly, control
signals to any other modules that might be listening. Your smart wardrobe (and
your friends' smart wardrobe) could always be in sync.
Make sure to comply with established local wireless regulations.
