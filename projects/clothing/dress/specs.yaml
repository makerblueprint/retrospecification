name: Dress
summary: Add luminous, amorphous & other sophisticated effects to a dress.
description: >
  Recently, dresses with semi-transparent outer layers have been adorned with
  multi-color LEDs sewn into the lower layers of the dress. The diffusion
  provided by the outer layers helps to hide the conductive thread & the
  somewhat unsightly LEDs themselves.
  More opaque dresses offer fewer avenues for accentuation. Consider
  integrating sanded fiber-optic cables around the edges... or EL wire if
  appropriate.
  Some designers are introducing shape-shifting accessories to dresses, which
  can certainly steal the show if executed well. Others are pushing far beyond;
  integrating beverage dispensing capabilities & automated animatronics.
ideas:
  - consider integrating wireless capabilities so the dress can sync up with
    other accessories you may have -- or clothes others near you may be wearing
