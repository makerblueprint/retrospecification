name: Bowtie
summary: Glowy. Spinny. Polka-dotty.
description: >
  Bowties are in a category of their own. Add some comedy with spinning effects
  -- or if you're feeling bold -- turn it into a `persistence-of-vision`
  display.
  Given its location near the vocal chords, consider adding a speaker for
  special effects playback and/or a microphone for voice command or additional
  special effects.
ideas:
  - consider integrating wireless capabilities so the bowtie can sync up with
    other accessories you may have -- or clothes others near you may be wearing
