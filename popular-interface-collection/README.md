Client Device Collection
========================
A growing collection of devices which offer simple hardware interfaces. Consider, as you make, what devices you have which can be easily adapted to the Retro Specification.

Have an old composite video screen and a GoPro? Make them both into Retro Modules. You can take it further by making video transmitter & receiver Retro Modules (research 'FPV'). You then have a wired/wireless GoPro video setup which can be assembled in seconds.
