name: Style Guide
notes: |
  This style guide helps ensure a consistent user experience as Retro Modules
  are used in various environments & configurations.
definitions:
  - The "top plane" is the largest plane closest to contact 1
  - The "left plane" is the smallest plane closest to contact 1 & perpendicular to the top plane.
  - Primary user interfaces are preeminent silkscreens, buttons, displays, etc.
styles:
  required:
    - Primary user interfaces are on the top plane
    - Primary user interfaces must flow down and to the right from the top left of the top plane
  recommended:
    - Any socket with a "key" in the specification should have a polarizing key inserted.
    - Power Supply Modules (e.g. a battery module) should typically have socket-style connectors
  important:
    - Interfaces that read from right to left should have the left side closest to contact 1
    - Positive polarity should be closest to the left plane
    basic_boards:
      - Header pins should typically extend from the _bottom_ of the circuitboard
      - When looking at a basic ciruit board from above, the board should extend up and to
        the right of pin 1
      - When looking at a ciruit board from above, connectors (DC, USB, coax, headphone, etc)
        should be placed along the top edge
nets:
  "The netname begins with netclass mnemonic followed by schematic sheet name, signal
  description/function and/or increment, separated by underscores (_)."
