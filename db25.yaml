description: The proposed Retro Specification for DB25 connectors. A straightforward collection of real-world-friendly connections.
summary: DB25 connectors were commonly used by consumers to connect printers, modems and other larger peripherals to traditional computers. They are often used by legacy point-of-sale systems.
  Since these are rarely found in modern computing, the connectors are prime candidates for respecification.
requirements:
  - Must be pin-compatible with off-the-shelf DE9 to DB25 adapters.
  - Pins 18 through 25 must be dead-short tolerant. Many printer cables tie these pins to ground.
  - Production modules' communication connections must be 5VDC tolerant.
ideas:
  - Make room for RS-485
  - More logical grouping of pin features while still maintaining DE9 adapter compatibility.
