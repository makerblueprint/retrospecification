name: DB-25 Connector
description: >
  DB25 connectors were commonly used by consumers to connect
  printers, modems and other larger peripherals to traditional
  computers. They are often used by legacy point-of-sale systems.
  Since these are rarely found in modern computing, the connectors
  are prime candidates for respecification.
requirements:
  -> Must be pin-compatible with off-the-shelf DE9 to DB25 adapters.
  -> Pins 18 through 25 must be dead-short tolerant.
     Many printer cables tie these pins to ground.
  -> Production modules must be able to tolerate 5VDC logic.
ideas:
  -> Make room for RS-485.
  -> More logical grouping of pin features while still
     maintaining DE9 adapter compatibility.
