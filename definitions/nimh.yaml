name: Nickel–Metal Hydride Battery
description: >
  A nickel–metal hydride battery, abbreviated NiMH or Ni–MH, is a type of
  rechargeable battery. The chemical reaction at the positive electrode is
  similar to that of the nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd), with both using nickel
  oxyhydroxide (NiOOH). However, the negative electrodes use a
  hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium. A NiMH battery can have two to
  three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd, and its energy density
  can approach that of a lithium-ion battery.
