name: Worbla
description: >
  Worbla plastics are different from other thermoplastics. They’re thinner
  than Wonderflex and handle curves better than Sintra, and Worbla products
  are non-toxic and don’t need special tools. You use hot air, water or steam
  to shape the plastic however you want. There’s no waste because your scraps
  can be conditioned and 100% re-blended. These leftovers can be molded to act
  just like putty, and many artists use Worbla’s Finest and Black like a form
  of clay.
