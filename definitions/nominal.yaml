name: Nominal
description: >
    From a philosophical viewpoint, nominal value represents an accepted
    condition, which is a goal or an approximation, as opposed to the real
    value, which is always present. Often a "nominal" value is "de facto"
    rather than an exact, typical, or average measurement.
    In various subfields of engineering, a nominal value is one for which the
    "name" for the value is close to, but not the same as, the actual value.
