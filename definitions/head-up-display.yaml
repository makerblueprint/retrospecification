name: Head-Up Display
description: >
  Any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look
  away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from a pilot
  being able to view information with the head positioned "up" and looking
  forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments. A HUD also has
  the advantage that the pilot's eyes do not need to refocus to view the
  outside after looking at the optically nearer instruments.
