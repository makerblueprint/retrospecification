name: Qualcomm Quick Charger
summary: Faster mobile charging by sending up to 12VDC over a Micro USB cable.
description: >
  For devices featuring `micro-usb`, charging speed has been an issue.
  Newer devices feature additional circuitry which can communicate with
  Qualcomm Quick Charge certified power supplies. When the power supply
  confirms the client device can receive a voltage other than 5VDC, it will
  attempt to send the higher specified voltage. The charging circuit in the
  client device can handle this higher voltage and put it to immediate use.
