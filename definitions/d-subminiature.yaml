name: D-Subminiature Connector Type
description:
  These connectors were named for their characteristic D-shaped metal shield.
  When they were introduced, D-subs were among the smallest connectors used on
  computer systems.
  A D-sub contains two or more parallel rows of pins or sockets usually
  surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support,
  ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic
  interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector
  or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector
  or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel
  mounted connectors usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable
  end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and
  offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a
  cable end connector if it is expected to connect to another cable end. When
  screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of
  the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole
  cable and connector system.
