summary: A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed
  to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in
  applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol,
  designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles, but
  is also used in many other contexts.
