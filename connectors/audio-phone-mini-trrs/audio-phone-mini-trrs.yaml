name: Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve Mini Phone Connector
summary: The connector found on most smartphone headphones.
description: >
  This connector is frequently used to route a pair of analog audio signals
  to a pair of headphones, and signal from a single built-in Electret mic.
  It is less-commonly used to route a pair of analog audio signals and a
  composite video signal from an AV device.
  Many older mobile devices featured `common` on the `sleeve` and
  `av-bus-audio-electret-mic` on `ring_1`. This spec was rejected in favor of
  `common` on `ring_1`. This allowed new headsets to be better compatible
  with both `trs` & `trrs` receptacles.
