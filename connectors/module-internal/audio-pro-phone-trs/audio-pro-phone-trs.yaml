name: Tip-Ring-Sleeve Phone Connector
summary: The connector found on many pro headphones.
description: >
  This connector is frequently used to route a pair of analog audio signals
  to a pair of headphones. It is also used for effects processing in pro-audio
  environments. The clean audio signal from the mixer is sent to the effects
  processor on the ring of the connector, and is sent back to the mixer via the
  tip -- allowing effects processing of a monoaural signal via a single cable.
  This spec includes a new proposal for chainable digital (AES) effects
  processors.
  See `audio-pro-chainable-aes-processor` & `audio-pro-xlr6` for more.
