name: Apple 30 Pin Dock
description: >
  Apple's proprietary 30-pin connector was common to most Apple mobile devices
  from its introduction with the 3rd generation iPod in 2003 until the
  Lightning connector was released in late 2012. Originally, the Apple dock
  connector carried USB, FireWire, some controls and line-level audio outputs.
  As the iPod changed, so did the signals in the dock connector.

  1kOhm: >
    iPod docking station, beeps when connected.
  10kOhm: >
    Takes some iPods into photo import mode.
  6_8kOhm: >
    Serial port mode. Pin 11-13 are TTL level. Requires MAX232 chip to convert
    to RS232 levels.
  68kOhm: >
    Makes iPhone 3g send audio through line-out without any messages.
  500kOhm: >
    Related to serial communication / used to enable serial communications Used
    in Dension Ice Link Plus car interface.
  1MOhm: >
    Belkin auto adaptor, iPod shuts down automatically when power disconnected
    Connecting pin 21 to common with a 1MOhm resistor does stop the ipod when
    power (i.e. Firewire-12V) is cut. Looks to be that when this pin is connected
    to common it closes a switch so that on loss of power the Ipod shuts off.
    Dock has the same Resistor.
