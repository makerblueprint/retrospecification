name: Pro Audio - AES - XLR
summary: Common connector for balanced audio signals.
notes:
  - This is the exact same connector, `audio-pro-xlr`, used for balanced analog
    audio. Mixers may be damaged if an XLR with AES signal is connected to an
    analog input. To help address this issue, this spec proposes use of the
    `audio-pro-xlr6` connector for AES audio instead.
