Connectors Likely Found Inside a Retro Module
=============================================
Consider, as you make, what devices you have which can be easily adapted to the
Retro Specification. One or more off-the-shelf devices may comprise a single
Retro Module. In this context, off-the-shelf device connections can be
considered "internal".

Have an old composite video screen and a GoPro? Make them both into Retro
Modules. Separately, make a pair of wireless AV Retro Modules (research 'FPV').
Once complete, you would have a wired/wireless GoPro video setup which can be
assembled in seconds.

Any combination of devices can be considered a module. Large devices, like a
car -- or a satellite -- can be considered modules. Each feature various
popular "internal" connections (OBD, M-Bus, USB Audio, etc.). An existing
module can be made into a Retro Module by exposing these "internal" connections
on a Retro Module connector.
