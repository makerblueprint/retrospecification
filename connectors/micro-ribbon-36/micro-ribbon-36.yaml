name: 36 Contact Micro-Ribbon Connector
summary: The companion Micro-Ribbon connector for a DB-25 connector.
description: >
  Common on old parallel printer cables, Micro-Ribbon connectors are an excellent
  choice for use in rough environments. Since there are no pins, no pins can be
  bent! Most modern connectors follow this practice: embed contacts along a
  wall of insulating material.
  Larger versions of these connectors, such as `micro-ribbon-50` are frequently
  used by telephone companies.
