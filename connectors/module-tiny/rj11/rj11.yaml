description: >
  These connectors are being used less and less frequently by consumers.
  It may be a bit too soon to respecify these connectors, but their
  inexpensive and generally hardy characteristics make them ideal
  candidates for re-specification. They are commonly used for telephone
  land-lines and DSL modems.
  Ideally, these will be the primarily used in wearable devices and
  to connect one set of modules to another over longer distances.
  Many hardware stores carry four-wire thin telephone cables. These
  four-wire cables can drive a small set of NeoPixels without issue.
  Six-wire cables add `canbus`.
