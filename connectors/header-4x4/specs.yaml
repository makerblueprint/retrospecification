  The SAO Header is awesome. It just works. Great for low-power add-ons!

  better power capabilities & the ability to connect client boards in any
  orientation.
  Four holes for 6-32 or 3mm screws may be added 1" from the center of the
  header. Each corner of the header points toward one of these holes.
