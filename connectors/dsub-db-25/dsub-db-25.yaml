name: DB-25 Connector
description: >
  DB25 connectors were commonly used by consumers to connect
  printers, modems and other larger peripherals to traditional
  computers. They are often used by legacy point-of-sale systems.
  Since these are rarely found in modern computing, the connectors
  are prime candidates for re-specification.
requirements:
  - Must be pin-compatible with off-the-shelf DE9 to DB25 adapters.
  - Contacts 18 through 25 must be dead-short tolerant.
     Some printer cables tie these pins to `common`.
capabilities:
  - DC Power
  - Analog HD Video
  - Analog SD Video
  - 4x Analog Line Level Audio Channels
  - CAN bus
  - SPI bus
  - I2C bus
  - ICSP
aliases:
  - D-sub 25
  - Parallel Port
  - Printer Port
notes:
  power_requests:
    simple:
      - There is a SPST relay controlling the connection between the power
        supply and the `forty-volts-max` contact.
      - The `forty-volts-max` contact is connected to the SPST reference
          contact.
      - The power supply positive is connected to the SPST 'Normally-Open'
        contact.
      - The SPST relay is energized if `common-power-request` is connected to
        `common`. This connects the power supply positive to the
        `forty-volts-max` contact.
    complex:
      - There is a microcontroller controlling the connection between the power
        supply and the `forty-volts-max` contact.
      - This microcontroller may be part of a typical ATX PC power supply.
      - Microcontrollers within different power supplies may coordinate.
        If `common-power-request` is connected to `common`, the power supply
        microcontrollers can automatically nominate one supply as the official
        power source, while all others go into standby mode.
