name: DE-15 Connector
description: >
  Commonly referred to as DB-15, DE-15 connectors were once frequently used
  by consumers to connect monitors to to traditional computers. These have
  largely been replaced by connectors which route video digitally (e.g. HDMI).
  Since DE-15 connectors are still frequently found in modern computing, they
  are not well suited for re-specification.
notes:
  - The official spec includes I2C support. See reference for more.
