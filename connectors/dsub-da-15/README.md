Enhanced Battery Connector
==========================
DA-15 connectors were commonly used by consumers to connect joysticks and
other peripherals to traditional computers. Since these are rarely found in
modern computing, the connectors are prime candidates for re-specification.

This connector is used by Battery Management Systems & similar devices.
See [header-16](../../../connectors/module-internal/header-16/README.md) for more.

The spec for this connector is defined [here](dsub-da-15.yaml).
