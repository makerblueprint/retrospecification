name: "'4 Way Round' Connector"
notes:
  - Since this connector has largely been abandoned by the automotive
    community, it has been repurposed here as a 12/24V power connector.
  - This connector does not typically have the contacts numbered. Given this
    issue, contacts are referred to by their position relative to the other
    pins & the main key. The main "key" on this connector is on the underside.
