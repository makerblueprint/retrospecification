name: DIN6 240
summary: Variable voltage module connector
description:
  This connector sports about 12 volts by default. This voltage
  may dip as low as 10 volts or as high as 15. This is to help support
  the vast array of 12VDC vehicle & RC accessories without introducing
  any extra complexity.
  If a device requires more than 12 volts, it can request it via the
  `one-wire-data` contact. It is merely a request, though. If there is a
  module regulating power on pins 4 & 5, it may adjust its output voltage
  if equipped to do so.
  To remain safe, modules should not provide more than 50VDC.
  Any voltages higher than 50VDC should be treated just like mains voltage.
  See some of the references below for more details.
