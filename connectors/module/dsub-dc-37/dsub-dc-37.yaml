notes:
  - The `fifty-volts-max` contacts help accomodate higher-voltage automotive
    power systems. Golf carts often run at 24 volts. Newer cars may run at
    48 volts. If there is power available on the `fifty-volts-max` pins, the
    module should use that voltage instead voltage which may be available on
    the `twelve-volts-nominal` contacts.
  - Each of the activity contacts, at minimum, should be able to tolerate
    voltages up to around 15VDC. Each should tolerate voltages up to 50VDC for
    the module to be considered compatible with all automotive power systems.
