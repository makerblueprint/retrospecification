name: DC-37 Connector
summary: The High-Def D-Sub
description: >
  The spec for this connector differs from other Retro Modules connectors, in
  that it is primarily intended to be used for connections between a host
  computer & peripheral(s).
  A common use case is a connection between an average laptop & a laptop dock.
  This connector may be more frequently used to connect one or more
  microcomputers to a backplane. The microcomputers might be configured as a
  cluster of web servers, data miners, or similar. This backplane might have
  an integrated network router & KVM functionality.
  Finally, it could be used to standardize legacy personal computer peripheral
  devices, such as a floppy disc drive, printer, 3D printer or CNC machine.
  The spec includes support for 4K digital HD Video, gigabit networking & USB3.
  Power-hungry devices will have no trouble running. With high-quality contacts
  & appropriate wiring, each connector can safely support an 800W device.
