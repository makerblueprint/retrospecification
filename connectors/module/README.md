Module Connectors
=================
These are the bread & butter of the Retro Specification.
The gist: connect one Retro Module to another & nothing cooks.

There are infinite use cases, which is why so many connectors are featured.
Most envisioned use cases are covered here. If you're wanting to build compact
and/or wearable Retro Modules, take a look at the [tiny connector collection](../module-tiny). If you're building hefty ones, [go here instead](../module-hefty).
