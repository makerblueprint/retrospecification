name: DD-50 Connector
summary: Automotive GPIO connector
description:
  While slightly harder to find, this connector remains one of the least
  expensive mass multi-pin connectors around. The spec below is optimized for
  varying automotive projects -- from tow lighting to ground effects to audio
  special effects.
  When working on an effects-related automotive project, much of the time is
  spent under the hood, in the trunk, or under the car. Building the central
  microcontroller into a Retro Module allows for much easier upgrades.
  Program the microcontroller, walk over to the car & plug it in.
notes:
  - The `mode-reference` contact should be connected to the vehicle battery.
    Internally, this reference voltage would be used to perform logic level
    conversion on any of the mode contacts. This allows for compatibility with
    variations in vehicles not using a `twelve-volts-nominal` operating voltage,
    and provides accomodation for fluctuations in general operating voltages.
  - Contacts like `mode-left-turn-lights` are ideal for sending activity into
    a microcontroller via a voltage level conversion circuit.
  - If the capabilities of this connector are insufficient, consider pairing
    it with a `dsub-db-25` connector.
