name: DD-50 Connector
summary: Automotive accessory connector.
description:
  While slightly harder to find, this connector remains one of the least
  expensive mass multi-pin connectors around. The spec below is optimized for
  varying automotive projects -- from tow lighting to ground effects to audio
  special effects.
  When working on an effects-related automotive project, much of the time is
  spent under the hood, in the trunk, or under the car. Building the central
  microcontroller into a Retro Module allows for much easier upgrades.
  Program the microcontroller, walk over to the car & plug it in.
notes:
  - `twelve-volts-nominal-switched` is intended to be connected to the circuit
    that remains on when the engine is on or the key is turned to ACC.
  - `twelve-volts-nominal-accessory` is intended to be connected to the
    `twelve-volts-nominal-auxiliary` contact on a `trailer-7-north-america`
    connector instead of the default connection. This allows custom control
    of the lights or devices on a trailer using that circuit (e.g. trailer
    lights illuminate when the truck bed light is on).
  - Other contacts like `twelve-volts-nominal-accessory` are intended for low
    to medium-current accessories.
  - Contacts like `twelve-volts-nominal-left-turn` are ideally for sending
    activity into a microcontroller via a voltage level conversion circuit.
    With those signals, the microcontroller may determine that a Raspberry Pi
    powered via `twelve-volts-nominal-accessory-4` should be turned on, or that
    the ground effects should all turn red & then fade out when a pattern like
    `engine off -> dome on -> blinkers blink once -> dome off` is encountered.
    More sophisticated effects are possible via analysis of CANBUS messages.
  - While LED lights are getting more & more efficient, take care to ensure
    contact current ratings are not exceeded. Newer premium pins may be capable
    of safely carrying a significant amount of current. If in doubt, a second
    DD-50 connector can be installed next to the first.
  - `av-bus-audio-special-effects` is intended to be the primary low-frequency
    analog audio signal from the car stereo head unit. This signal is usually
    routed into an amplifier & to a subwoofer.
  - `av-bus-audio-special-effects-1` is intended for 'show-off-mode' style
    analog sound effects. Custom sound effects when unlocking/locking the car
    come to mind. It may also be used for a secondary low-freqency analog audio
    signal from the car stereo head unit.
  - The analog audio signals can be analyzed & used to create sound-responsive
    visual effects.
  - The analog audio signals sent through this connector may pick up noise from
    some of the other contacts. If this proves to be an issue, route the audio
    signals into the module via another connector. The noise may not be
    noticable if in a typical outdoor environment.
  - Contacts like `speaker-x-positive` are for reserved for active signals
    generated from a small audio amplifier. These signals may be the amplified
    av-bus-audio-special-effects signals.
