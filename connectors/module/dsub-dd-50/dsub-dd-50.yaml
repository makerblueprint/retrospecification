name: DD-50 Connector
summary: Automotive GPIO connector
description:
  While slightly harder to find, this connector remains one of the least
  expensive mass multi-pin connectors around. The spec below is optimized for
  varying automotive projects -- from tow lighting to ground effects to audio
  special effects.
  When working on an effects-related automotive project, much of the time is
  spent under the hood, in the trunk, or under the car. Building the central
  microcontroller into a Retro Module allows for much easier upgrades.
  Program the microcontroller, walk over to the car & plug it in.
notes:
  - The `v-reference` contact should be connected to the vehicle battery.
    Internally, this reference voltage would be used to perform logic level
    conversion on any of the `v-*` contacts. This allows for compatibility with
    variations in vehicles not using a `twelve-volts-nominal` operating voltage,
    and provides accomodation for fluctuations in general operating voltages.
  - Contacts like `v-left-turn-lights` are ideal for sending activity into
    a microcontroller via a voltage level conversion circuit.
  - If the capabilities of this connector are insufficient, consider pairing
    it with a `dsub-db-25` connector.
  - The `common-switched*` contacts can be used with microcontrollers, relay
    coils, switches and/or similar functionality.
