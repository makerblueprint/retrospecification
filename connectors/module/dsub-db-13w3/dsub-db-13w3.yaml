name: DB-13W3 Connector
description: >
  This connector is not common, but has a common form factor.
  It features three pins well suited for high-current applications,
  and ten pins for general purpose applications.
  This connector is a variant of a once-popular video connector with
  the same layout. Instead of three high-current pins, three
  coaxial connectors were present.
summary: A high-current version of DB-25.
