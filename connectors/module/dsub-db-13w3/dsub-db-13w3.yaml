name: DB-13W3 Connector
summary: Multi-Cell 30V Max 40A Max Rechargeable Battery Pack Connector
aliases:
  - mixed d-sub
notes:
  - Connector may accomodate either 20A or 40A on A1, A2 & A3.
  - A2 & A3 share `common` via A1. Calculate max `current` accordingly.
  power_requests:
    simple:
      - There is a SPST relay controlling the connection between the battery series
        and the `thirty-volts-max` contact.
          - The `thirty-volts-max` contact is connected to the SPST reference
            contact.
          - The battery series positive is connected to the SPST 'Normally-Open'
            contact.
          - The SPST relay is energized if `common-power-request` is connected to
            `common`. This connects the battery series positive to the
            `thirty-volts-max` contact.
    complex:
      - There is a microcontroller controlling the connection between the battery
        series and the `thirty-volts-max` contact.
        - Microcontrollers within different batteries may coordinate.
          If `common-power-request` is connected to `common`, the battery
          microcontrollers can automatically nominate one battery as the official
          power source, while all others go into standby mode.
  - Battery packs may include an internal 5V regulator.
      - If Included:
        - Would be off & disconnected from the `regulated-five-volts`
          contact, by default.
        - When `regulated-five-volts-request` is connected to `common`,
          the 5V regulator would be configured to turn on & the connection to
          the `regulated-five-volts` contact would be made.
        - The 5V regulator could also be controlled via CAN.
  - Battery packs may include an internal Battery Management System (BMS).
      - If Included:
        - The BMS board can be powered from the `thirty-volts-max` contact
          when `battery-request` is not connected to `common`.
        - Most BMS boards will require a voltage regulator to refine the
          varying voltages that may be found on the `thirty-volts-max` contact.
        - Certain BMS boards have SMBus (an I2C variant) contacts. Information
          available on these contacts could be transmitted over CAN via a
          microcontroller.
  - While primarily intended to be used with multi-cell battery packs, this
      connector can also merely be used as a 5V regulated and/or 30V max 40A
      max power connector.
  - Consider used `20700` batteries for your battery pack.
  - Consider used `18650` batteries for your battery pack.
  - Consider the `25R` series of `18650` batteries for better performance.
