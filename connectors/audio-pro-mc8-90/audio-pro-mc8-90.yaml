tips:
  - A monaural boom mic can be connected via
     the balanced contacts.
  - More and more directors are finding it valuable
     to have their conversation recorded when near their
     camera operator(s). This provides greater context to
     post-production technicians.
     Use the balanced contacts for a high-quality mic, or the
     av-bus-audio-mic contact pin for an inexpensive one.
     Cheap electret mics (like those found in wired cell phone headsets)
     may be powered via a voltage regulator connected to pins 7 & 8.
  - Headphone amplifier(s) may be powered via 48VDC Phantom
     power on the balanced audio line, or 48VDC power on pins
     7 & 8.
  - Modern field digital audio recorders may feature
     limited monitor mix capabilities. It is possible to
     have a monaural mix on Channel 1 (left) and  a separate
     monaural mix on Channel 2 (right).
     In the case of a sound technician & boom operator, the boom mic
     can be present on both channels, and everything else on
     Channel 2. This is accomplished by fading all the
     desired channels to the right. This allows the boom op
     the ability to focus on just the sound from their mic.
     Use the av-bus-audio-boom-mix contact for this
     headphone-level audio & connect it to both sides
     of the boom operator's headphones.
  - Modern field digital audio recorders may feature
     a setting which chirps whenever recording begins. If
     reference audio is routed from the recorder into the
     camera, this beep can be used to sync the sources in post.
     Use the `av-bus-audio-camera-mix` contact for monaural
     line-level reference audio.
