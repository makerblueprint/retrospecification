name: 80 contact Single Connector Attachment
summary: Recently deprecated SCSI backplane connector.
description: >
  A type of connection used for the internal cabling of SCSI systems.
  SCA is no longer in widespread use, having been superseded by
  Serial attached SCSI.
  This connector was specifically designed for hot-pluggable hard drives.
  The contacts below remain optimized for hot-plugging... of Retro Modules.
  If you're looking to build a flush-mount hot-pluggable RasPi module, for
  instance, consider hacking up an old SCA SCSI hard drive, tray & bay. When
  you need to service the module, simply eject it from its housing.
  Since the 80 contact connector is a `micro-ribbon` connector, the risk of
  damaged contacts is greatly reduced.
