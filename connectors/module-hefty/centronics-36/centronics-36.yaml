name: 36 Contact Centronics Connector
summary: The companion Centronics connector for a DB-25 connector.
description: >
  Common on old parallel printer cables, Centronics connectors are an excellent
  choice for use in rough environments. Since there are no pins, no pins can be
  bent! Most modern connectors follow this practice: embed contacts along a
  wall of insulating material.
  Larger versions of these connectors are extensively used by telephone
  companies.
