  While bluetooth audio capabilities are present in many vehicles, they are
  often for voice communication or standard-quality music playback. There are
  better ways to pipe audio into older car stereos. This connector is an
  excellent choice for automotive audio modules which may need a recharge.
  You may notice there are no analog contacts on this connector. Instead,
  S/PDIF can be used for audio transmission. Take special care to keep CAN
  signals isolated from S/PDIF signals. S/PDIF is best transmitted via coaxial
  cable & is not the most resilient of signals.
  Modern smartphones do not feature CAN, S/PDIF, nor can they tolerate 30VDC.
  With a relatively small enclosure, though, the power on the thirty-volts-max
  contact can be regulated to five volts (or be piped into a
  `qualcomm-quick-charge-adapter`). The analog audio can be converted to S/PDIF
  with a audio ADC chip. What about CAN? Well most smart devices can have basic
  media control via certain resistances on the mic contact.
  Add a `microcontroller` into your enclosure & have it convert serve up this
  method of control to the CAN bus. Another `microcontroller` can be in-dash,
  communicating with the `microcontroller` in the cable. Behind the car stereo,
  convert that S/PDIF signal back to analog (most car stereos lack S/PDIF).
  If you want to have even more fun with stereos that boast old-school iPod
  control, connect the in-dash `microcontroller` to the stereo's iPod interface
  (see `apple-30-pin`, or `alpine-m-bus`).
  Now you can charge & control any modern smartphone via an elegant cable
  solution & your old car stereo. Add more excellence, if you wish, via an
  `ioio-otg` board or similar.
  Finally, take a look at the connector. Do you think it can support the weight
  of a 3D printed dock? No? What about if the panel-mount connector faces
  skyward? Happy hacking...
