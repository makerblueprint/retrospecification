name: 16mm 2 Pin Aviation Connector
description: >
  Often called an Aviation Plug, these connectors are well-known for their
  reliability. They help ensure robust connections in harsh environments.
tips:
  - Modules should have male connectors, while cables should have
     female connectors. This configuration prevents situations
     where a cable was run, but the connectors are mismatched.
     Most panel-mount versions of this connector are male.
     The risk of bent pins is also reduced.
