Direct-Current Power Connectors
===============================
These connectors are expected to feature `nominal` DC voltages. As with the
rest of the Retro Specification, the goal is standardize & reduce risk of fried
components. You won't see any `cylindrical-connector` in the collection, due to
ubiquitous use & lack of established standards.

RC Battery Connectors
---------------------
Many DC low-voltage connectors are used by RC enthusiasts. These connectors
usually feature only `positive` & `negative` contacts. They do not generally
have voltage specifications. The newer `deans-ultra-plug`,
`anderson-power-poles` & `traxxas-high-current-connector` are typically found
on 3.7V `lipo` batteries. The more traditional `tamiya-connector` is typically
found on 7.2V & 9.6V `nimh` batteries. `jst` plugs are also frequently used
but are not generally associated with specific voltages.
