name: 4 Pin 'AMP' Molex Connector
summary: Basic DC power distribution.
description: > Most often used to power legacy hard drives, Molex brand
  connectors are a prime candidate for basic DC power distribution. It is
  easy to retrofit an old desktop power supply to provide nice clean & steady
  power to your electronics projects.
  12VDC and 5VDC wall worts can be modified to feature this connector instead
  of the typical barrel connector.
  If you're lucky, you may stumble upon an old power brick which supplies both
  12VDC & 5VDC on separate wires. The brick may have once supplied power to an
  external hard drive enclosure.
