# DE-9 Connector
![DE-9 Connector](image.jpg)

Commonly referred to as DB-9, DE-9 connectors were commonly used
by consumers to connect modems, mice and other small peripherals
to traditional computers. They are often used by professionals
who wish to utilize the older RS-232 or RS-422 protocols.
Since these are rarely found in modern computing, the connectors
are prime candidates for re-specification.
