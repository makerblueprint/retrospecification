name: DE-9 Connector
description: >
  Commonly referred to as DB-9, DE-9 connectors were commonly used
  by consumers to connect modems, mice and other small peripherals
  to traditional computers. They are often used by professionals
  who wish to utilize the older RS-232 or RS-422 protocols.
  Since these are rarely found in modern computing, the connectors
  are prime candidates for re-specification.
